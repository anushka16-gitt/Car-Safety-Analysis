# Car-Safety-Analysis
This project analyzes the safety ratings of various car models using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib/Seaborn for data visualization. The goal is to derive insights into how features like price, horsepower, and car type influence safety scores. Ideal for anyone exploring EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) and data-driven insights in the this domain.
