## About the Project 📚

The **Car Safety Analysis** project evaluates car safety metrics using the dataset provided and uncovers patterns and insights that can assist consumers, manufacturers, and regulators. Through this project, we aim to:

- Perform comprehensive data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Visualize relationships among key safety parameters.
- Build predictive models to classify car safety ratings.
- Share findings through interactive visualizations.

---

## Key Features 🎯

- **Data Exploration**: Uncover trends and distributions of safety parameters.
- **Visualization**: Dynamic and static visualizations to make data accessible.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Predictive models for classifying car safety levels.
- **Insights for Action**: Practical recommendations based on analysis.
